  <h1>🔴 Day 4 – The Odin Recipes Project Begins</h1>

  <p>Today I officially started my first real Odin project: <strong>Odin Recipes</strong>. After learning how to write solid commit messages, I created the index page and began adding recipe pages for some of my favorite Hausa dishes — <em>Suya (Tsire)</em>, <em>Wainar Shinkafa</em>, and <em>Dambun Nama</em>. Seeing my culture represented in my code felt deeply motivating. It wasn’t just “HTML practice” anymore — it was personal.</p>

  <p>The big challenge wasn’t writing HTML — it was <strong>moving files</strong> between my laptop and phone. I ran into issues pushing and pulling from GitHub using both <em>the laptop terminal</em> and <em>Termux</em>. Fetching and syncing code between devices was confusing at first.</p>

  <p>But I discovered something useful: it’s <strong>easier</strong> to move files <em>from Termux to the Micro editor</em> and manage things there, than trying to fetch files directly from GitHub to VS Code on the laptop.</p>

  <p>These small victories made me realize: <strong>knowing how to move your code around is as important as writing it</strong>.</p>

  <p>I also updated my Odin Dev Diary with today’s progress. While I haven’t finished the full project yet, I’ve made solid ground. The recipes are showing up, the structure is in place, and Git is slowly becoming less scary.</p>

  <p>I’m learning by doing, just as I promised.<br>
  <strong>Onward.</strong></p>
