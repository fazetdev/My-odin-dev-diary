  <title>Odin Dev Diary – Day 3</title>

  <h1>Day 3 – Hello HTML, My Old Friend 👋💻</h1>

  <p>Back to HTML, where every tag feels like a warm, familiar hug. I revisited all the basics — html, head, body, p, strong, em, img, a, and more — creating tiny pages that proudly said things like <em>“Hello World”</em> and <em>“I’m Back, Odin!”</em>. It felt like catching up with old friends after a long break.</p>

  <p>🔥 <strong>Today was a huge milestone:</strong> I finally started building <strong>My Odin Dev Diary</strong> website! This idea had been floating in my head since Day 1, but now it’s real. The site will track every step of my Odin journey as a living web diary — a place for Odin Labs (the official projects) and Personal Lab (my own experiments). It’s like turning my daily grind into a story worth telling.</p>

  <p>📅 Weeks and daily logs inside weeks will come later, with plans to spice things up with CSS and JavaScript down the road. This feels like the first real spark of something meaningful.</p>

  <h2>Success:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Kicked off my Odin Dev Diary website — a real commitment to growth and discipline.</li>
    <li>Completed most foundational HTML lessons.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Difficulty:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Accidentally closed divs that were never opened.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Solution:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Read my code aloud like a dramatic monologue. Surprisingly effective.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>📝 There’s a chapter on commit messages I need to finish before diving into the Odin recipes projects — but for today, I’m just proud of turning ideas into action.</p>
