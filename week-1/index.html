    <h2>Week 1: Setup, Sync, and the Start of Style</h2> <p><p>DATE thursday 12 june 2025</p></p>
    <p>Welcome to the chaotic beauty of Week 1 — where I officially kicked off my Odin Project journey with equal parts caffeine and confusion. 
        This week was all about laying the foundation: getting my dev setup ready, battling Git (and mostly surviving), and building this very diary you're reading.</p>

<h3>🛠️ The Setup Saga</h3>
    <p>I connected my phone and laptop into one coding unit like some kind of budget Iron Man. Between Termux, GitHub, and some very focused 2-hour laptop sprints (RIP my battery), I made sure nothing — not even dying power — could stop this dream.
    </p>
<h4>📁 The Mini Diary Project Begins</h4>
<p>Inspired by the Odin Git lessons, I created this little web diary to document every week of my learning. Not just for fun, but also to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Test what I’ve learned</li>
    <li>Practice real-world Git workflows</li>
    <li>Track my growth in a way future-me (and maybe recruiters 👀) can look back on
    </li>

</ul>

<h4>🧠 What I Actually Learned</h4>
<p>This week, I dove into the core of the Odin curriculum:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Git & GitHub: Cloning, committing, pushing, and learning
    </li>
    <li>HTML Basics: Tags like p, strong, img, and a became my new besties</li>
    <li>Starting CSS: A splash of style to stop my diary from looking like a Word document from 2003</li>

</ul>
