  <h1>🔵 Day 5 – Odin Recipes: Cooked, Linked & Deployed 🧑‍🍳</h1>
  <p><strong>Date:</strong> June 16, 2025</p>

  <p>Today, I finally served my first Odin Project dish—the <strong>Odin Recipes project</strong>! After days of HTML appetizers, this was the real entrée. I created the index page, linked recipe pages, added mouth-watering food images, and carefully followed the Odin structure like a chef following Grandma’s secret lasagna recipe.</p>

  <p>The hardest part? Not the code—but <strong>file paths</strong>. Yep, the folder structure gave me more heartburn than spicy jalapeño poppers. Just connecting the pages with proper links took me longer than I’d like to admit. But eventually, it all clicked!</p>

  <p>As Odin commands, I <strong>pushed the finished project to GitHub</strong>—not because I'm being extra, but because it’s literally part of the curriculum. So here's the proof of my delicious dev work:</p>

  <p>👉 <strong>GitHub Repo:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/fazetdev/odin-recipes.git" target="_blank">https://github.com/fazetdev/odin-recipes.git</a></p>

  <p>There were still some hiccups with command line setups, especially juggling between <strong>Termux</strong> and <strong>VS Code</strong>, but I’ve almost mastered this two-device life now.</p>

  <p>Now I’m eyeing the <strong>CSS lessons</strong> next—if real life doesn’t cook up distractions first.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>✅ <strong>Success:</strong> Project finished and pushed like a boss.</li>
    <li>⚠️ <strong>Difficulty:</strong> File linking chaos.</li>
    <li>💡 <strong>Solution:</strong> Took a deep breath, re-read Odin’s example, and sipped on imaginary coffee.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>One project down, a thousand bugs to go. But hey, we move. 🍕🧑‍💻🚀</p>
