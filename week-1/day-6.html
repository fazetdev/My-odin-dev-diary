  <h1>Day Six: First Touch of CSS — From Chaos to Curves</h1>

  <p>
    Today felt like finally finding the seasoning in the Odin stew — <strong>CSS</strong> has arrived!
  </p>

  <p>
    After navigating the land of HTML tags and bold enthusiasm, I dived headfirst into the beautiful chaos of <strong>Cascading Style Sheets</strong>. The first topic of Odin’s CSS curriculum is now officially behind me. 🎉
  </p>

  <p>
    I also wrestled with GitHub once again — this time, learning how to <em>fork a repository</em> (which is basically adopting someone else's code child), and cloned the mighty <strong>CSS exercises repo</strong>. The practice questions were straightforward but also sneaky in the way only real coding exercises can be. It felt good to solve each one.
  </p>

  <p>
    But the real icing on today’s dev cake? I gave my humble little <code>aboutme.html</code> some much-needed drip — by writing and linking a <strong>simple CSS file</strong>. Suddenly, the text didn’t look like it was begging for mercy on a blank screen. It had margin! Color! Personality! A hint of style, finally.
  </p>

  <h2>✅ Wins</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Finished Odin’s <strong>first CSS lesson</strong>.</li>
    <li>Forked, cloned, and completed <strong>css-exercises</strong> repo.</li>
    <li>Styled the <code>aboutme.html</code> page with real CSS — no longer a plain orphan file.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>😖 Challenges</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Forking vs cloning was briefly confusing. Git can be like a roommate who hides your socks until you learn his habits.</li>
    <li>Getting Termux to align with GitHub felt like syncing two stubborn cousins — but they’re cooperating now.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>💡 Solutions / Notes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Now that I know how to fork, clone, pull, push, and even style, I’m officially ready to start treating CSS like a proper second language.</li>
    <li>Still keeping that 6–7 hour goal alive (at least in spirit).</li>
  </ul>
