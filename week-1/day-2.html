      <h1>🔧 Day 2 – Gitting It Together</h1>
    
      <p>
        With my tools now in hand (or phone, literally), I jumped into Git and terminal setup. I’ve seen some of these commands before, but they still felt like decoding ancient scrolls — or worse, Harry Potter spells with no wand.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        I reinstalled VS Code on my laptop, set up Git in both my laptop’s terminal and Termux on my phone. After a bit of digital diplomacy, both environments finally shook hands and agreed to be co-workers. Now whether I’m coding on my laptop or phone, Git doesn’t complain — they both get the job done.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        I also created my first <code>repos</code> folder — the new headquarters for all things Odin. From now on, anything Odin asks me to build lives there. No more random folders or messy file hunting. Just clean, committed work.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        I opened a fresh Discord account and joined the official Odin Project channel. It feels like entering a secret coding dojo.
      </p>
    
      <h2>✅ Success:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Git works on both laptop and phone</li>
        <li>Termux and Terminal now act like co-workers instead of strangers</li>
        <li>Created a dedicated <code>repos</code> folder for all Odin projects</li>
        <li>Joined the Odin Discord server</li>
        <li>Completed “Introduction to Git” and “Git Basics”</li>
      </ul>
    
      <h2>⚠️ Difficulty:</h2>
      <p>Remembering the difference between <code>git add .</code> and <code>git add -A</code></p>
    
      <h2>💡 Solution:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Took notes like a serious student</li>
        <li>Re-read Git docs (again!)</li>
        <li>Practiced dummy commits until I could do it without thinking</li>
      </ul>
    
      <p><strong>Day 2 logged. Git's good. I’m ready for more pushes and pulls. 🚀</strong></p>
