      <h1>üîß Day 2 ‚Äì Gitting It Together</h1>

      <a href="../index.html" class="button">Go to Home</a>
      <p>

        With my tools now in hand (or phone, literally), I jumped into Git and terminal setup. I‚Äôve seen some of these commands before, but they still felt like decoding ancient scrolls ‚Äî or worse, Harry Potter spells with no wand.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        I reinstalled VS Code on my laptop, set up Git in both my laptop‚Äôs terminal and Termux on my phone. After a bit of digital diplomacy, both environments finally shook hands and agreed to be co-workers. Now whether I‚Äôm coding on my laptop or phone, Git doesn‚Äôt complain ‚Äî they both get the job done.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        I also created my first <code>repos</code> folder ‚Äî the new headquarters for all things Odin. From now on, anything Odin asks me to build lives there. No more random folders or messy file hunting. Just clean, committed work.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        I opened a fresh Discord account and joined the official Odin Project channel. It feels like entering a secret coding dojo.
      </p>
    
      <h2>‚úÖ Success:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Git works on both laptop and phone</li>
        <li>Termux and Terminal now act like co-workers instead of strangers</li>

        <li>Joined the Odin Discord server</li>
        <li>Completed ‚ÄúIntroduction to Git‚Äù and ‚ÄúGit Basics‚Äù</li>
      </ul>
    
      <h2>‚ö†Ô∏è Difficulty:</h2>
      <p>Remembering the difference between <code>git add .</code> and <code>git add -A</code></p>
    
      <h2>üí° Solution:</h2>

        <li>Took notes like a serious student</li>
        <li>Re-read Git docs (again!)</li>
        <li>Practiced dummy commits until I could do it without thinking</li>
      </ul>
    
      <p><strong>Day 2 logged. Git's good. I‚Äôm ready for more pushes and pulls. üöÄ</strong></p>
