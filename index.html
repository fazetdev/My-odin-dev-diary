   <h1> 🌐 The Odin Quest of Faruk
   </h1>

<h2> From Biology to Brackets — One Line of Code at a Time  </h2>

<p>
    Hey there! I'm Faruk Bashir Aminu, a former biology teacher from Nigeria who's swapped test tubes for test cases. With a BSc in Applied Biology and a love for learning, I’ve kicked off a bold new journey: becoming a full-stack web developer.

   <p>
       This site is my public Odin Project diary — a living timeline of trials, errors, “aha!” moments, and late-night bug hunts. If you're reading this, welcome aboard my dev ship 🚢.
