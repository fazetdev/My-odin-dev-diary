  <h1>Personal Lab – My Creative Coding Experiments</h1>

  <p>
    Welcome to my Personal Lab — a space dedicated to creativity, exploration, and self-expression through code.
  </p>

  <p>
    Unlike my Odin Lab, which focuses on structured lessons and exercises from The Odin Project, this section is where I bring my own ideas to life. From small tools and design experiments to unique website layouts and personal challenges, every project here is an opportunity to practice, grow, and try something new.
  </p>

  <p>
    This lab represents the fun and freedom of learning to code. Each project is a step forward, a lesson learned, and a reflection of my curiosity.
  </p>

  <p>
    Feel free to explore, and watch as this space evolves with every new idea.
