  <h1>Personal Lab – My Creative Coding Experiments</h1>
<a href="aboutme.html">About Me</a>
  <p>
    <strong>Welcome to my Personal Lab — a space dedicated to creativity, exploration, and self-expression through code.</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    Unlike my Odin Lab, which focuses on structured lessons and exercises from The Odin Project, this section is where I bring my own ideas to life.
  </p>

  <p>
    This lab represents the fun and freedom of learning to code. Each project is a step forward, a lesson learned, and a reflection of my curiosity.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>Feel free to explore, and watch as this space evolves with every new idea.</em>
  </p>
