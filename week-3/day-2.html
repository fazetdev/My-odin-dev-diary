  <h1>üü† Day 2 ‚Äì Full Attack on the Landing Page</h1>

  <p>Today I went all in on the Landing Page project. I dedicated the day to trying everything possible to push the design forward. I made full use of the Odin Project resources, revisited my notes, and even checked explanations from other sources to reinforce my understanding.</p>

  <p>I switched between using SPCK Editor on my phone and VS Code on my laptop, depending on what was accessible. I made steady progress and committed my changes to GitHub, which felt rewarding. I even started to see clearly where the design problems were and what was causing some layout frustrations.</p>

  <p>But as the day went on, time slipped away. I realized I wouldn‚Äôt be able to solve everything in one sitting, so I made the call to leave the unfinished work and continue tomorrow.</p>

  <p>
    <strong>‚úÖ Success:</strong> Re-engaged with the Landing Page project, used multiple resources, and committed progress to GitHub.<br>
    <strong>‚ö†Ô∏è Difficulty:</strong> Time constraints kept me from fully finishing what I started.<br>
    <strong>üí° Solution:</strong> Recognized the limits of the day and paused intentionally to continue fresh tomorrow.
