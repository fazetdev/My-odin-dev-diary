  <h1> Day 1 ‚Äì Slowed Down but Still Showing Up</h1>
   <a href="day-2.html">day-2.html</a>

  <p>Today didn‚Äôt go as planned. I was caught up with other things and barely had any free time until late in the evening. Unfortunately, that meant no major progress on my Odin Landing Page project or the curriculum itself.</p>

  <p>Still, I didn‚Äôt let the day go to waste completely. I used the time I had to explore Flexbox concepts further by reading more explanations and experimenting inside SPCK Editor on my phone. I also asked ChatGPT some targeted questions to help solidify things I was still struggling with ‚Äî especially layouts and alignment.</p>

  <p>It wasn‚Äôt a productive day in terms of project work, but it was still a step forward in understanding. Some days aren‚Äôt about output; they‚Äôre about keeping the flame alive.</p>

  <p class="key-point">
    <strong>‚úÖ Success:</strong> Kept the momentum alive by practicing and learning.<br>
    <strong>‚ö†Ô∏è Difficulty:</strong> Busy schedule left very little time for focused work.<br>
    <strong>üí° Solution:</strong> Focused on small, flexible learning using ChatGPT and mobile tools.
