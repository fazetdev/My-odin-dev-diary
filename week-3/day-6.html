  <h1>🔵 Day 6 – Styling the Past & Streamlining the Workflow</h1>

  <p>
    Today was about catching up and cleaning up. I returned to my earlier diary pages from <strong>Week 1 and Week 2</strong> 
    and gave them a much-needed style update. I added structure, cleaned messy tags, and made the content feel more polished. 
    It felt good to bring consistency to my past work and see how far I’ve come in terms of writing, formatting, and attention to detail.
  </p>

  <p>
    But the highlight of today wasn’t just styling—it was attempting to <strong>fix the chaos between SPCK and Termux</strong>. 
    Up until now, I was stuck in a strange loop: edit in SPCK → open Termux → find the file → open in Micro → copy-paste → 
    commit to GitHub. Not efficient.
  </p>

  <p>
    So I tried to change that. I worked on creating a folder system that lets me easily navigate between both tools. 
    My goal: <em>open files in SPCK, edit freely, then push through Termux without any copy-pasting</em>. 
    Although I haven’t fully achieved that seamless flow yet, I found a compromise — I now open the same file in SPCK, 
    then make final commits and Git pushes through Micro and Termux directly.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>✅ <strong>Success:</strong> Styled older pages and improved their structure</li>
    <li>⚠️ <strong>Challenge:</strong> Navigating the SPCK-Termux integration smoothly</li>
    <li>💡 <strong>Solution:</strong> Started building a shared folder strategy that connects both tools more directly</li>
  </ul>
