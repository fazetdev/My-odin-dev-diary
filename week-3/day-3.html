  <h1>🟢 Day 3 – Starting Fresh, Finishing Strong (At 4AM!)</h1>

  <p>Today I made a bold move — I deleted all my previous CSS and started over from scratch. It felt risky, but it turned out to be the right decision. This time, I approached it with clearer understanding and better structure.</p>

  <p>Using both SPCK Editor on my phone and VS Code on my laptop, I made solid progress and rebuilt about 80% of the layout and styling. Later in the day, I handed the code over to AI to review both my HTML and CSS. The feedback? A solid 7 out of 10 — not bad at all.</p>

  <p>One key lesson was about naming classes. Previously, I named things randomly or out of frustration. But now, I learned to give each class a clear, meaningful name based on what it styles or does. It made my code more organized and easier to understand.</p>

  <p>I paused for a while, but then decided to continue at night — and didn’t stop until 4AM. By the time I closed my editor, the landing page looked much closer to the assignment reference image, and I had fixed several tricky layout issues. It was exhausting, but very satisfying.</p>

  <p>
    <strong>✅ Success:</strong> Rebuilt my CSS from scratch, improved naming conventions, and pushed the project to 95% completion.<br>
    <strong>⚠️ Difficulty:</strong> Lots of small layout issues and long hours of trial-and-error.<br>
    <strong>💡 Solution:</strong> Took AI feedback seriously, applied naming discipline, and committed to a deep work session — even if it meant staying up all night.
