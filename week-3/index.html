  <h1>ðŸ”µ Week 3 â€“ Styling, Finishing, and Preparing for JavaScript</h1>

  <p>This week feels like a milestone. After spending time learning and applying CSS, Iâ€™m now determined to complete and submit the Odin Landing Page project â€” and not just eventually, but within the first day or two. The goal is to get it done early and done well, so I can move forward with a clean slate.</p>

  <p>Alongside that, Iâ€™ll also take time to revisit and style other pages Iâ€™ve built during this journey, using everything I now understand about selectors, box model, and layout systems. Itâ€™s a good chance to make those pages feel less like raw code and more like something Iâ€™d actually be proud to show off.</p>

  <p>There are still layout quirks and design details to iron out, especially when it comes to responsiveness and organization, but Iâ€™m more confident now. I understand where Iâ€™m improving, and more importantly, where I still need to sharpen up.</p>

  <p>By the end of this week, Iâ€™ll definitely be moving on to JavaScript basics. Itâ€™s been a long road to get here, but I finally feel like Iâ€™ve earned the right to start writing some logic. The idea of making my pages interactive is exciting â€” and a clear sign that the foundation phase is truly coming to an end.</p>
