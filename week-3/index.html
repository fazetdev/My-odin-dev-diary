  <h1>🔵 Week 3 – Styling, Finishing, and Preparing for JavaScript</h1>

  <p>This week feels like a milestone. After spending time learning and applying CSS, I’m now determined to complete and submit the Odin Landing Page project — and not just eventually, but within the first day or two. The goal is to get it done early and done well, so I can move forward with a clean slate.</p>

  <p>Alongside that, I’ll also take time to revisit and style other pages I’ve built during this journey, using everything I now understand about selectors, box model, and layout systems. It’s a good chance to make those pages feel less like raw code and more like something I’d actually be proud to show off.</p>

  <p>There are still layout quirks and design details to iron out, especially when it comes to responsiveness and organization, but I’m more confident now. I understand where I’m improving, and more importantly, where I still need to sharpen up.</p>

  <p>By the end of this week, I’ll definitely be moving on to JavaScript basics. It’s been a long road to get here, but I finally feel like I’ve earned the right to start writing some logic. The idea of making my pages interactive is exciting — and a clear sign that the foundation phase is truly coming to an end.</p>
