  <h1>üü£ Day 7 ‚Äì Goodbye CSS, Hello JavaScript!</h1>

  <p>
    Today started off with me tweaking some CSS across a few of my pages. But honestly? I hit a wall. The motivation just wasn‚Äôt there, and I felt like I was forcing it. So I took a step back and made a decision ‚Äî it‚Äôs time to wrap up CSS (for now) and move forward. I had planned to maybe build another landing page or two‚Ä¶ but my brain had other plans.
  </p>

  <p>
    I dove into <strong>JavaScript</strong>, and it felt like a fresh breeze.
  </p>

  <p>
    To get a better roadmap, I had a long chat with ChatGPT, asking how to successfully and effectively complete The Odin Project‚Äôs Foundation path. It helped clear my thoughts and suggested practical ways to pace myself. One thing I learned: <strong>SPCK is still good enough for JS</strong>, especially for the basics. For more advanced work, I got advice to use <strong>Kiwi Browser</strong> later when needed.
  </p>

  <p>
    I started the <strong>JavaScript basics</strong> section on Odin, reached the lesson on variables, and went ahead to install what I‚Äôd need ‚Äî Node.js and other tools. No errors, no drama. That alone made the day memorable.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>‚úÖ <strong>Success:</strong> Finally transitioned from CSS to JavaScript and set up my JS environment</li>
    <li>‚ö†Ô∏è <strong>Challenge:</strong> Frustration with CSS made it hard to stay focused</li>
    <li>üí° <strong>Solution:</strong> Listened to myself, made a clean switch, and asked for guidance</li>
  </ul>
