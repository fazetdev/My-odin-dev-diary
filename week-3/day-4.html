  <h1>🔵 Day 4 – Final Polish, AI Review, and Submission</h1>

  <p>Today I made only a few minor changes to my CSS — mostly small adjustments to spacing and alignment. Then I took a screenshot of my final work and asked Gemini AI to compare it to the reference image from the project.</p>

  <p>The result? A proud 9.5 out of 10!</p>

  <p>That was all I needed to hear. The Odin Project itself had already made it clear: don’t stress over pixel-perfect designs. With that in mind, I decided my work was solid, functional, and visually close enough to the target.</p>

  <p>So I made my final commit, pushed everything to GitHub, and officially submitted the Landing Page project!</p>

  <p>With that off my chest, I turned my focus to polishing other pages and progressing with my personal landing page project, <strong>Tsire Hub</strong>.</p>

  <p>
    <strong>✅ Success:</strong> Submitted the Landing Page project after AI-rated review.<br>
    <strong>⚠️ Difficulty:</strong> Final details were mostly about spacing and visual tweaks.<br>
    <strong>💡 Solution:</strong> Trusted the process, avoided perfectionism, and closed the chapter with confidence.
