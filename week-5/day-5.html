  <h2>üß± Day 5 ‚Äì Arrays and Looping</h2>
  <li><a href="../index.html" class="button">Go to Home</a></li>

  <h3>üß† What I Learned</h3>
  <p>
    Today I dived deeper into working with arrays and loops. I explored different ways to create and manipulate arrays, like using `.push()`, `.pop()`, `.shift()`, and `.slice()`. I also practiced using `for`, `while`, and `for...of` loops to iterate through arrays.
  </p>

  <h3>üß™ Experiments</h3>
  <p>
    I built a small program that loops through an array of numbers, finds the average, and returns only the even numbers. I also made a dynamic shopping list using arrays and practiced modifying it in real-time using loops and array methods.
  </p>

  <h3>‚ùå Problems</h3>
  <p>
    I initially mixed up the differences between `.map()`, `.filter()`, and `.forEach()`. I also had issues with off-by-one errors in loops, but using `console.log` helped me trace and fix the problems.
  </p>

  <h3>üå¨Ô∏è Wind (Motivation)</h3>
  <p>
    Seeing how arrays and loops can handle large amounts of data with minimal code gave me confidence. I now understand why loops and arrays are considered core tools for programmers‚Äîthey're like powerful hammers and saws in a toolbox.
