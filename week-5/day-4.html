  <h2>üß± Day 4 ‚Äì Functions & Scope</h2>
  <li><a href="../index.html" class="button">Go to Home</a></li>

  <h3>üß† What I Learned</h3>
  <p>
    I learned how to write reusable blocks of code using functions. I explored both function declarations and function expressions. I also learned how JavaScript handles variable scope‚Äîlocal and global‚Äîand how closures allow functions to "remember" variables from the context they were created in.
  </p>

  <h3>üß™ Experiments</h3>
  <p>
    I created a calculator function that handles addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. I also experimented with higher-order functions and built a simple function that returns another function. Additionally, I played with closures and observed how they preserve the environment where they were created.
  </p>

  <h3>‚ùå Problems</h3>
  <p>
    I had a bit of confusion with how closures work, especially in loops. Also, I initially struggled with understanding the difference between passing a value directly and passing a function as a parameter. Practice and console logging helped clarify.
  </p>

  <h3>üå¨Ô∏è Wind (Motivation)</h3>
  <p>
    The fact that functions allow me to write less code and do more excites me. Reusability is powerful, and closures felt like a little bit of magic‚Äîsomething hidden but useful. This gave me a deeper appreciation of JavaScript's flexibility.
