  <h2>🌀 Day 1 – Clean Code</h2>
  <li><a href="../index.html" class="button">Go to Home</a></li>

  <h3>🧠 What I Learned</h3>
  <p>
    I explored the idea of Clean Code — not just making the program work, but making it readable, understandable, and maintainable. I revisited old code to improve variable names, remove redundancy, and simplify logic. I learned that code should be written for humans first, machines second.
  </p>

  <h3>🧪 Experiments</h3>
  <p>
    I practiced rewriting old functions and loops to be cleaner and easier to follow. I added meaningful comments and tested renaming variables to express intent clearly.
  </p>

  <h3>❌ Problems</h3>
  <p>
    Some of the resources felt repetitive. Concepts overlapped, and switching between multiple sources made it feel slightly boring. It was difficult staying focused at some point.
  </p>

  <h3>🌬️ Wind (Motivation)</h3>
  <p>
    The idea that I’m not just learning to code — but to write something others can understand — gave me purpose. I want to be someone whose code is praised for being elegant, not just functional.
