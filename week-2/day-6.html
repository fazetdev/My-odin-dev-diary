  <h1>🟠 Day 6 – Styling, Struggling, and Smart Help</h1>

  <p>Today I rolled up my sleeves and really got into the CSS exercises. I began applying everything I had learned so far — from selectors to box model — directly into my Odin Dev Diary and other pages. It felt like giving my work a well-deserved wardrobe upgrade.</p>

  <p>I also attempted the official Odin CSS exercises. I didn’t finish all of them, but I made solid progress. Some challenges were straightforward, but others — especially those involving box sizing and layout — felt like walking through a maze blindfolded.</p>

  <p>So I did what any smart developer does when stuck: I called in backup. I used AI (yes, that’s you, ChatGPT) to deeply understand how box models behave, and I rewatched Flexbox lessons while experimenting in the code.</p>

  <p>I wouldn’t call it a breakthrough, but things are starting to make more sense. My styles are sharper, and my confidence is slowly coming back.</p>

  <p><strong>✅ Success:</strong> Applied CSS to real pages and completed some exercises.<br>
  <strong>⚠️ Difficulty:</strong> Box model and layout logic slowed me down.<br>
  <strong>💡 Solution:</strong> Used AI for explanations, visual tools, and lots of trial-and-error in real files.</p>
