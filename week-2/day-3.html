    <h2>üîµ Day 3 ‚Äì Flexbox Confusion & Froggy Relief</h2>
    <a href="./index.html" class="button">Go to Home</a>
    <p>
      Today I stepped into the world of <strong>Flexbox</strong> ‚Äî and instantly felt like I was back to square one.
      The lessons made sense at first. I understood the idea of containers, flex directions, and alignment...
      at least in theory.
    </p>

    <p>
      But once I reached the assignments, everything fell apart. I couldn‚Äôt center anything properly, and the layout
      kept breaking no matter what I tried. It felt like trying to solve a puzzle with half the pieces missing ‚Äî
      frustrating and humbling.
    </p>

    <p>
      So I changed tactics. I paused the Odin assignments and jumped into the <strong>Flexbox Froggy</strong> game instead.
      Honestly, it saved me. The visual feedback and playful setup made the concepts click in a way pure reading couldn‚Äôt.
    </p>

    <p>
      I finished the game and came out a bit more confident. Still not fully ready to fight the six Flexbox challenges again,
      but at least I no longer feel completely lost. Sometimes the detour is the real lesson.
    </p>

    <h3>‚úÖ Wins:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Learned the basics of Flexbox layout (container, direction, alignment)</li>
      <li>Completed all Flexbox Froggy levels for hands-on practice</li>
      <li>Started connecting theory to visual results</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>‚ö†Ô∏è Problem:</h3>
    <p>Struggled to center elements and understand alignment rules in real code</p>

    <h3>üí° Realization:</h3>
    <p>Visual learning (like games) can fill the gap between theory and practice</p>

    <p><strong>Day 3 finished. Flexbox fears softened. üéÆüß†</strong></p>
