  <h1>ðŸ”µ Day 3 â€“ Flexbox Confusion & Froggy Relief</h1>

  <p>Today I stepped into the world of <strong>Flexbox</strong> â€” and instantly felt like I was back to square one. The lessons made sense at first. I understood the idea of containers, flex directions, and alignment... at least in theory.</p>

  <p>But once I reached the assignments, everything fell apart. I couldnâ€™t center anything properly, and the layout kept breaking no matter what I tried. It felt like trying to solve a puzzle with half the pieces missing â€” frustrating and humbling.</p>

  <p>So I changed tactics. I paused the Odin assignments and jumped into the <strong>Flexbox Froggy</strong> game instead. Honestly, it saved me. The visual feedback and playful setup made the concepts click in a way pure reading couldnâ€™t.</p>

  <p>I finished the game and came out a bit more confident. Still not fully ready to fight the six Flexbox challenges again, but at least I no longer feel completely lost. Sometimes the detour is the real lesson.</p>
