  <h1>ðŸŸ¤ Day 5 â€“ Rewind, Relearn, Reapply</h1>

  <p>After taking a break yesterday, I came back with a clearer mind â€” and a plan. I decided to rewind everything Iâ€™d covered in CSS so far: selectors, box model, and flexbox. This time, I didnâ€™t just read â€” I took notes, tested code, and reconnected the dots.</p>

  <p>Surprisingly, things made more sense now. Concepts that felt abstract earlier suddenly clicked, especially in flexbox. I could now see the logic behind alignment and spacing â€” not just copy and paste code blindly.</p>

  <p>With that clarity, I started <strong>adding CSS to my actual projects</strong>. My Odin Dev Diary and other practice pages finally began to take shape visually. It felt amazing to see them transform from basic HTML to something more styled and alive.</p>

  <p>The most satisfying part? Applying what Iâ€™ve learned instead of just following examples. Iâ€™m not just learning CSS anymore â€” Iâ€™m actually using it.</p>
