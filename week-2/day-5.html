    <h2>🟤 Day 5 – Rewind, Relearn, Reapply</h2>

    <p>
      After taking a break yesterday, I came back with a clearer mind — and a plan. 
      I decided to rewind everything I’d covered in CSS so far: selectors, box model, and flexbox. 
      This time, I didn’t just read — I took notes, tested code, and reconnected the dots.
    </p>

    <p>
      Surprisingly, things made more sense now. Concepts that felt abstract earlier suddenly clicked, especially in flexbox. 
      I could now see the logic behind alignment and spacing — not just copy and paste code blindly.
    </p>

    <p>
      With that clarity, I started <strong>adding CSS to my actual projects</strong>. 
      My Odin Dev Diary and other practice pages finally began to take shape visually. 
      It felt amazing to see them transform from basic HTML to something more styled and alive.
    </p>

    <p>
      The most satisfying part? Applying what I’ve learned instead of just following examples. 
      I’m not just learning CSS anymore — I’m actually using it.
    </p>

    <h3>✅ Wins:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Reviewed selectors, box model, and flexbox from scratch</li>
      <li>Wrote notes and practiced code instead of passively reading</li>
      <li>Styled real projects with improved understanding</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>⚠️ Problem:</h3>
    <p>Initial confusion with Flexbox layout logic returned — but was resolved through review</p>

    <h3>💡 Realization:</h3>
    <p>Repetition and real application unlock real understanding</p>

    <p><strong>Day 5: reset, recharged, and ready for the next push. 💪</strong></p>
