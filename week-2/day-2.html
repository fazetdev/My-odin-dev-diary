  <h1>ðŸŸ¡ Day 2 â€“ Inside the Box (Model)</h1>

  <p>Today was all about understanding the invisible structure behind every element: the <strong>Box Model</strong>. At first, it felt like an abstract concept, but the more I played with margins, padding, borders, and content â€” the more it all started to make sense. Itâ€™s like every element has its own personal bubble, and CSS gives you full control of how tight or roomy that bubble should be.</p>

  <p>The lessons were clear, but what helped me most was experimenting directly in the browser â€” adjusting values and watching boxes expand, shrink, or move. I learned how padding pushes content inward, margins push elements apart, and borders sit right in between.</p>

  <p>After that, I tackled the two assignments. They werenâ€™t too difficult, but they definitely required attention to detail. A small mistake in spacing or misreading box behavior could throw everything off. Still, it was satisfying seeing things align just right.</p>

  <p>This was the day I started appreciating that good layout isnâ€™t just design â€” itâ€™s structure and spacing done intentionally. The Box Model is like the skeleton of visual organization, and now that Iâ€™ve seen it in action, Iâ€™ll never ignore it again.</p>
