    <h2>🟡 Day 2 – Inside the Box (Model)</h2>

    <li><a href="../index.html" class="button">Go to Home</a></li>
    <p>
      Today was all about understanding the invisible structure behind every element: the <strong>Box Model</strong>.
      At first, it felt like an abstract concept, but the more I played with margins, padding, borders, and content —
      the more it all started to make sense. It’s like every element has its own personal bubble, and CSS gives you
      full control of how tight or roomy that bubble should be.
    </p>

    <p>
      The lessons were clear, but what helped me most was experimenting directly in the browser — adjusting values and
      watching boxes expand, shrink, or move. I learned how padding pushes content inward, margins push elements apart,
      and borders sit right in between.
    </p>

    <p>
      After that, I tackled the two assignments. They weren’t too difficult, but they definitely required attention to detail.
      A small mistake in spacing or misreading box behavior could throw everything off. Still, it was satisfying seeing
      things align just right.
    </p>

    <p>
      This was the day I started appreciating that good layout isn’t just design — it’s structure and spacing done intentionally.
      The Box Model is like the skeleton of visual organization, and now that I’ve seen it in action, I’ll never ignore it again.
    </p>

    <h3>✅ Wins:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Understood padding, margin, border, and content roles</li>
      <li>Visualized the box model through direct browser experiments</li>
      <li>Completed two box model assignments successfully</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>⚠️ Problem:</h3>
    <p>Spacing confusion early on — needed extra testing to see how it all connects</p>

    <h3>💡 Realization:</h3>
    <p>The Box Model is the foundation of layout — spacing is as important as styling</p>

    <p><strong>That wraps it for Day 2 — layout logic unlocked. 🧠✅</strong></p>
