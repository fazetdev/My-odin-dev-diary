  <h1>üü¢ Day 7 ‚Äì Flexbox Stories and Landing Page Beginnings</h1>
  <a href="./index.html" class="button">Go to Home</a>
  <p>Today, I officially started the Odin Landing Page Project ‚Äî my first real challenge since going deep into Flexbox. But before diving in, I did something unusual: I asked AI to generate different stories and scenes to help me understand Flexbox more clearly. And weirdly, it worked. Flexbox started making more sense in a fun, visual way.</p>

  <p>With that boost, I created the HTML structure for my landing page. Then I moved on to CSS. Let‚Äôs just say... it‚Äôs a work in progress. Some parts look okay, others made me laugh out loud ‚Äî not out of joy, but because of how broken they were. Still, progress is progress.</p>

  <p>I also used AI again to help me extract the text from the reference image. It was hard to see everything clearly on mobile, and this saved me a lot of time and guesswork. From there, I built the HTML content piece by piece.</p>

  <p>The page is still rough and unfinished, but I‚Äôm learning and pushing forward.</p>

  <p>
    <strong>‚úÖ Success:</strong> Started the Landing Page Project and built the HTML with extracted content.<br>
    <strong>‚ö†Ô∏è Difficulty:</strong> Styling was hard, and reading reference images on mobile was frustrating.<br>
    <strong>üí° Solution:</strong> Used AI to analyze the image and guide my layout + content structure.
