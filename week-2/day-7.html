  <h1>🟢 Day 7 – Flexbox Stories and Landing Page Beginnings</h1>

  <p>Today, I officially started the Odin Landing Page Project — my first real challenge since going deep into Flexbox. But before diving in, I did something unusual: I asked AI to generate different stories and scenes to help me understand Flexbox more clearly. And weirdly, it worked. Flexbox started making more sense in a fun, visual way.</p>

  <p>With that boost, I created the HTML structure for my landing page. Then I moved on to CSS. Let’s just say... it’s a work in progress. Some parts look okay, others made me laugh out loud — not out of joy, but because of how broken they were. Still, progress is progress.</p>

  <p>I also used AI again to help me extract the text from the reference image. It was hard to see everything clearly on mobile, and this saved me a lot of time and guesswork. From there, I built the HTML content piece by piece.</p>

  <p>The page is still rough and unfinished, but I’m learning and pushing forward.</p>

  <p>
    <strong>✅ Success:</strong> Started the Landing Page Project and built the HTML with extracted content.<br>
    <strong>⚠️ Difficulty:</strong> Styling was hard, and reading reference images on mobile was frustrating.<br>
    <strong>💡 Solution:</strong> Used AI to analyze the image and guide my layout + content structure.
