    <h2>🟢 Day 1 – CSS, Meet My Brain</h2>
    <li><a href="./index.html" class="button">Go to Home</a></li>
    <p>
      Today officially marked the beginning of my journey into CSS. After finishing my first real HTML project, 
      I dove into the basics of styling — and wow, it clicked faster than I expected.
    </p>

    <p>
      I covered the introductory lessons and quickly jumped into selector types: tag, class, ID, and more. 
      To my surprise, the six selector exercises were genuinely enjoyable — like assigning behavior and personality to elements.
    </p>

    <p>
      Compared to HTML, CSS felt more expressive. Instead of just building structure, I was now shaping the entire 
      <em>vibe</em> of a page. It’s like painting over the blueprint I just built.
    </p>

    <h3>✅ Wins:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Completed introductory CSS lessons</li>
      <li>Finished all six selector exercises</li>
      <li>Gained confidence with tag, class, and ID selectors</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>⚠️ Problem:</h3>
    <p>None major today — just soaking it all in</p>

    <h3>💡 Realization:</h3>
    <p>CSS isn’t just style — it’s power, control, and creativity in one</p>

    <p><strong>Let’s keep the momentum rolling. Week 2, Day 1: done. 🎯</strong></p>
