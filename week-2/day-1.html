  <h1>ðŸŸ¢ Day 1 â€“ CSS, Meet My Brain</h1>

  <p>After completing my first real HTML project, today I officially began learning <strong>CSS</strong>. I started with the introductory lessons and quickly moved into the world of selectors â€” tag, class, ID, and more.</p>

  <p>To my surprise, the six selector exercises were actually fun. It felt like assigning digital rules to control how elements behave and appear. Each successful attempt made me more confident.</p>

  <p>Compared to HTML, CSS felt more expressive â€” like shaping not just structure, but the entire vibe of a page.</p>

  <p>By the end of the day, I had completed the intro and selector tasks. A smooth start with no real challenges â€” just excitement for whatâ€™s ahead.</p>
