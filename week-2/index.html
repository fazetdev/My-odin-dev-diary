  <h1>🗓️ Week 2 – Stepping into Style (and Git Trouble)</h1>

  <p>This week marks the beginning of my CSS journey — the phase where raw HTML starts to wear real clothes. From learning how to select elements, to understanding how every piece on a webpage is really just a box in disguise, I’ve been diving deeper into what makes pages beautiful and functional.</p>

  <p>But this week wasn’t just about colors and layouts — it came with its own tough technical drama. My setup involves both <strong>Termux</strong> on mobile and the <strong>terminal</strong> on my laptop, and trying to manage Git across both led to a nearly disastrous merge conflict. For a moment, it felt like I might lose everything I’d worked on. Merging nearly stopped the entire week — or worse, could have broken the whole project.</p>

  <p>I had to take a step back, cool off, and even ask <strong>ChatGPT</strong> to guide me through Git problems that went way beyond what the Odin curriculum had covered so far. That was my mini retreat — not from coding, but from mental overload.</p>

  <p>Despite the stress, I managed to push through. I resolved the issues, protected my work, and continued learning. By the end of the week, I wasn't just styling pages — I was debugging, recovering, and documenting like a real dev.</p>

  <p>This week was about discovery, struggle, technical survival, and building confidence. Here's how it all unfolded, day by day.</p>
