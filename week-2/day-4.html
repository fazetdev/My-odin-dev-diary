  <h1>ðŸŸ£ Day 4 â€“ Pause, Retreat, Recharge</h1>

  <p>Today I hit a wall. After days of non-stop coding, learning, and struggling with Flexbox, I realized my brain wasnâ€™t absorbing anything anymore. I opened the Flexbox assignments again, stared at them for a while, and felt nothing but confusion.</p>

  <p>Thatâ€™s when I knew â€” I needed a break.</p>

  <p>Instead of forcing my way through, I decided to <strong>pause</strong> and take the day off. Not just from the keyboard, but mentally too. No tutorials, no Git battles, no layout drama. Just rest.</p>

  <p>It felt a bit guilty at first, but I reminded myself: burnout doesn't build progress. Reflection does. Stepping back today means coming back sharper tomorrow.</p>

  <p>Sometimes the most productive thing you can do... is stop.</p>
