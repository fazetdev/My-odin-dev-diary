    <h2>🟣 Day 4 – Pause, Retreat, Recharge</h2>
 <a href="../index.html" class="button">Go to Home</a>
    <p>
      Today I hit a wall. After days of non-stop coding, learning, and struggling with Flexbox, 
      I realized my brain wasn’t absorbing anything anymore. I opened the Flexbox assignments again, 
      stared at them for a while, and felt nothing but confusion.
    </p>

    <p>
      That’s when I knew — I needed a break.
    </p>

    <p>
      Instead of forcing my way through, I decided to <strong>pause</strong> and take the day off. 
      Not just from the keyboard, but mentally too. No tutorials, no Git battles, no layout drama. Just rest.
    </p>

    <p>
      It felt a bit guilty at first, but I reminded myself: burnout doesn't build progress. Reflection does. 
      Stepping back today means coming back sharper tomorrow.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sometimes the most productive thing you can do... is stop.
    </p>

    <h3>✅ Wins:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Recognized signs of burnout early</li>
      <li>Chose rest over forcing unproductive work</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>⚠️ Problem:</h3>
    <p>Mental fatigue made it hard to retain or apply Flexbox concepts</p>

    <h3>💡 Realization:</h3>
    <p>Rest isn’t weakness — it’s a strategy for sustainability</p>

    <p><strong>Day 4: logged, rested, and ready to return stronger. 🌱</strong></p>
