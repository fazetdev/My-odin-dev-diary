<h2> From Biology to Brackets — One Line of Code at a Time  </h2>

<p>
    Hey there! I'm Faruk Bashir Aminu, a former biology teacher from Nigeria who's swapped test tubes for test cases. With a BSc in Applied Biology and a love for learning, I’ve kicked off a bold new journey: becoming a full-stack web developer.
    
</p>
   <p>
       This site is my public Odin Project diary — a living timeline of trials, errors, “aha!” moments, and late-night bug hunts. If you're reading this, welcome aboard my dev ship 🚢.
   </p>
   <h3> 
🎯 The Big Why  </h3>

   <p>Here’s what I’m after:

  <h1>Welcome to Odin Lab – My Journey Through The Odin Project</h1>

  <p class="first-line">
    This space is a personal archive of all the projects I’ve built while following <strong>The Odin Project</strong>,
    a full-stack web development curriculum designed to take learners from zero to developer.
  </p>

  <p>
    Each project here reflects a specific lesson, concept, or skill I’ve learned — from basic HTML and CSS
    to JavaScript, Git, and beyond. Whether it’s creating a recipe website, building a landing page,
    or learning to style layouts with Flexbox, every step represents growth.
  </p>

  <p>
    The lab is organized to help me track my progress, share my work, and stay motivated
    as I move forward in my web development journey.
  </p>

  <p>
    Feel free to explore each project, read the code, and see how my skills improve over time.
    This is more than just a collection of files — it’s a timeline of learning, practice, and discovery.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Let the learning continue!</strong></p>
