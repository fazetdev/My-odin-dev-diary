      After deciding to take the task personally, I focused fully and completed the assignment on JavaScript function basics in Odin. It felt good to finally finish that section. From there, I continued to the next reading, which covered problem-solving and understanding JavaScript errors. Both of these topics seem very important and practical.

      However, because I'm currently using a phone, I noticed that the developer console experience is very limited. I couldn't fully interact with the debugging tools or visualize the output the way I would on a laptop. So I decided to hold off and revisit both chapters — “Developer Tools” and “Understanding Errors” — once I’m on a proper computer. I sincerely intend to come back to them soon so I can understand how to inspect code, catch bugs, and handle real-world problems more effectively.

    <div class="summary-label">Success:</div>
    <div>Completed Odin’s function basics assignment and explored new topics on error handling.</div>

    <div class="summary-label">Difficulty:</div>
    <div>Phone console is too limited to properly learn developer tools and debugging. Delaying full understanding until I get on a laptop.</div>

    <div class="summary-label">Reflection:</div>
    <div>Felt good to take control and complete tasks. Realized the importance of a proper development setup for deep learning.</div>
