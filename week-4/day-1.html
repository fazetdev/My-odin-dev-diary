  <h1>üóìÔ∏è Day 1 ‚Äì Week 4</h1>
  <p>I started JavaScript with variables on Odin. I had no difficulty with them, and it was an eventful session. Odin prefers using the console for output, but I personally prefer using <code>alert</code>. I went through each of the assignments carefully and completed them.</p>

  <p>However, I found it a little bit boring reading from different sources and going over the same concepts repeatedly. While repetition can be helpful for mastery, doing it across multiple platforms in a short time made it feel slightly tedious.</p>

  <p>Despite that, I‚Äôm determined to push through. 
    I know it‚Äôs part of the learning curve, and I trust that
     the consistency will pay off when I begin building 
     real projects.</p>
