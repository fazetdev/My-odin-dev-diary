      Today I began the third JavaScript project in The Odin Project — Rock Paper Scissors. I didn’t do much yet; I mainly set up the folder structure, created the `index.html` and `script.js` files, and ensured the console setup is working.

      Since the game is currently console-based, there isn’t much need for an elaborate HTML structure right now. I kept the page minimal with a simple boilerplate setup and linked the script properly to test the console output. I plan to return and build out the game logic fully, then maybe extend it into a visual interface later.
    </div>

    <div class="summary-label">Success:</div>
    <div>Initialized the project with correct files and basic console structure.</div>

    <div class="summary-label">Difficulty:</div>
    <div>No coding challenge yet, but I still hesitate when thinking about how to structure the logic ahead.</div>

    <div class="summary-label">Reflection:</div>
    <div>Progress might seem small, but setting up the environment helps reduce friction for the next steps. Ready to move forward with logic next session.</div>
