      <h2>Successes</h2>
      <p>
        I now understand the concept of data types and conditionals better. Although I haven’t mastered them fully, I’m confident I’ve made real progress. I’ve also moved on to learning about Developer Tools as guided by AI, which feels refreshing and new.
      </p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Difficulties</h2>
      <p>
        I’m still finding it hard to grasp every detail of data types and conditionals. The repetition is tiring, and it’s not easy to stay motivated when the learning feels slow or unclear.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p>
        Even though I’ve moved forward, I continue to revisit the data types lesson because I know how important it is to fully understand. My goal is still to get to 100% understanding, but I accept that it may take more time and patience.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Developer Tools lesson gives me a mental break from logic-heavy topics while still making progress. It’s helping me build a rounded understanding of real-world JavaScript development.
