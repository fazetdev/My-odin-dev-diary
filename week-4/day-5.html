      I still find data types difficult. Although I’ve gone through all the items and exercises, I often feel unsure and question whether I’ve really grasped it all. Today, I tried once again to approach it differently by using my most effective method — generating a story to explain it clearly. I used Gemini AI to turn a confusing part into a story that made complete sense. It clicked immediately. That helped me not just understand it better, but also remember it more easily.

      After getting past that, I was finally able to tackle the last part of the Odin lesson. With more confidence, I moved on to practicing a few small but complex projects that forced me to apply what I’d learned. It felt like a big win, especially after feeling stuck.

      Still, I didn’t feel fully satisfied. That’s why I kept rereading parts of the data types and conditionals section — not because I didn’t understand, but because I didn’t feel 100% confident yet. I know these concepts are foundational, and if I rush through them, I might struggle later.

      Eventually, I transitioned into the next topic: JavaScript functions. They already feel more exciting and practical, but I’m still switching back and forth to review the basics. I just want to be sure I’m not leaving gaps behind.

    <div class="summary-label">Success:</div>
    <div>Understood the final outcome of data types, applied it in projects, and moved into function basics.</div>

    <div class="summary-label">Difficulty:</div>
    <div>Still feel inadequate and unsure. Reading multiple sources made things repetitive and sometimes more confusing.</div>

    <div class="summary-label">Reflection:</div>
    <div>Stories from AI helped again. I now realize I prefer deep clarity before moving forward.</div>
