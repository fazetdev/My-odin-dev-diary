    <h1>Week 4 – Day 3</h1>
    <p>Today, I discovered that there’s a lot more to <strong>data types</strong> than I initially thought. I came across many related concepts that clearly need a deeper and more thorough understanding because they form the foundation of JavaScript.</p>

    <p>To make learning more effective, I returned to one of my best learning strategies—asking an AI to turn the concept into a story. I used Gemini AI to create stories that helped me grasp the concepts better and remember them more easily.</p>

    <p>This approach gave me great results. Afterward, I even started experimenting with small personal projects to put some of the ideas into practice and deepen my understanding.</p>
